# Intelligent-Video-Monitoring-Analysis-System
An AI Powered IoT System to Detect Objects Using Jetson Nano and Analyze the Meta-Data in the AWSÂ Cloud

Introduction:
The convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) has redefined the way industries, economies, and business functions. AI enabled IoT system creates intelligent machines that simulate smart behavior and helps in decision making with little or no human involvement. However, handling and management of multitude of data coming from countless of IoT devices is a complex task.
The IoT is generating an unprecedented amount of data and the one component that improves the success of the IoT is Cloud Computing. Here I am discussing an Intelligent Video Monitoring and Analytics System, which integrates the IoT and the Cloud worlds. Precisely, to setup & configure Jetson Nano as an IoT (Edge AI) device and transfer the data to AWS cloud for analysis. MQTT protocol is used to transfer the data to cloud.
